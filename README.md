Aura Smart Glass is an assistive technology solution designed to support visually-impaired individuals through real-time object detection, navigation assistance, and multilingual audio feedback. The system uses computer vision techniques to identify obstacles in the user’s path and provides instant voice alerts to guide safe movement. Developed using Python and OpenCV, the project combines wearable hardware integration with intelligent navigation logic to deliver an intuitive, hands-free experience. My contributions included implementing core parts of the object detection workflow, supporting navigation logic, assisting with multilingual audio feedback integration, and participating in debugging and testing to ensure smooth system performance.
